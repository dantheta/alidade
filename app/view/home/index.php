                <h2>How the Tool Selection Assistant can help you</h2>
                <p>From research conducted in Kenya and South Africa, we found that many organisations had significant problems choosing the right digital tool. The Tool Selection Assistant is a guide that can help you make the right digital tool selection by improving the way that you make your decision.</p><p>In mid-2015, we interviewed 40 organisations in Kenya and South Africa working on transparency, citizen reporting and increasing government accountability about a time when they had adopted a technology tool to use in a project. We then picked out four key steps where they could have made their decision-making process more effective, and brought them together in the Tool Selection Assistant.<br></p>
                <h2>How The Tool Selection Assistant Works</h2><p>Our research found that organizations often avoided important questions when choosing a tool, but then faced bigger headaches later on. The Tool Selection Assistant helps you avoid this by walking you through four steps, each of which contains critical questions that you will need to address.</p><p>The Tool Selection Assistant also collects your decisions as you complete each step. If you log in, you can print or save the results when you have completed each section, using them:</p><ul><li>as a planning document to remind you of what to prioritise and clarify</li><li>to explain to your colleagues what you want the tool to do, using simple language</li><li>to quickly show people outside your organization what you’re looking for – so they can give advice or technical support</li><li>to show potential donors or partners that you’ve really thought through your project</li></ul><h2>If you need help, you are not alone</h2><p>For the organisations we spoke to, a tool often played a crucial role in deciding whether a project succeeded or failed. However, most of these organisations did limited research, did not look at more than one option, and didn’t test the tool with the people they hoped would use it.</p><p>The most common reasons for failure were:</p><ul><li>The tool didn’t work as the organisation expected it to – or it didn’t work at all.</li><li>The tool’s intended users didn’t use it in the way the organisation had hoped.</li><li>The project took much longer or cost much more than planned (or both).</li><li>The organisation was unable to find a technical partner that they could work with well.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Case Study: We didn’t plan properly what we really wanted. And we didn’t look at other options…<br>Next time we would consult more widely and not assume we knew what we wanted.</p><p>Case Study: We had decided we were going to use SMS, but we did not do any research.<br>The use of the tool went poorly… the efficiency we thought we’d have is not there.</p></blockquote><p>The organisations that made successful selections picked a tool that matched the time, resources and technical capacity they had available: they kept things as simple as they could.</p>
