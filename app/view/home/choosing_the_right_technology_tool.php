<h1>Choosing the right technology tool: <small>quick tips for success</small></h1>

<p>If you don’t have time to go through the full framework, read this instead.</p>
<p>These tips, based on real-life examples, point out important things to remember when selecting a digital tool for a project. It focuses on our key finding – that if you avoid hard questions at the start, you will probably face bigger headaches later on. </p>

<h2>Understand your needs</h2>
<h3>What did the research say?</h3>
<p>Less than 20% of the organizations we surveyed considered their tool a success.</p>
<p>Projects often underestimated the time, skills and effort they needed to put into choosing or using a tool.</p>
<p>Most projects didn’t do much research before choosing a tool, which can create challenges down the road.</p>

<h3>Tips for success</h3>
<p>Do just enough planning. You don’t always have to invest lots of time and money to pick a successful tool – but you should take a moment to determine how much you actually know about how the tool will be used, and then ask whether whether additional research and planning might be a good idea. </p>
<p>Start with the objective. Begin the process by deciding what job the tool needs to do, and how it will help you achieve that objective. </p>
<p>Understand your users. Think hard about what the tool’s users need, how they currently use digital tools, and why they would want to use your tool. Ask around and do some research if appropriate. </p>

<h2>Finding tools</h2>
<h3>What did the research say?</h3>
<p>Organizations rarely looked at more than one tool, and only occasionally did both user research and tool research.</p>
<p>Most organizations stretched, and some completely exceeded, their capacity when adopting new tools. Initiatives often felt that they lacked enough expertise to make an informed choice.</p>
<p>Organizations that were confident about their ability to use technology were not always objective.</p>
<h3>Tips for success</h3>
<p>Avoid tools that are far beyond your organization’s current technical capacity: they can lead to complicated, lengthy processes that are difficult to manage.</p>
<p>Find at least two different tools that might work, and compare them with each other.</p>
<p>Before you decide to build a new tool from scratch, double-check that an existing tool couldn’t do the job. (It might be cheaper, with fewer risks and uncertainties).</p>
<p>Learning about new tools is hard: ask others what has worked for them. Before trying to use tools or strategies in other countries or projects, check whether a new context will lead to differences.</p>

<h2>Try it out</h2>
<h2>What did the research say?</h2>
<p>Organisations found it very helpful to get hands on-experience using a tool before choosing it for the project.</p>
<p>Even when an organization found the tool they tried wasn’t right, they often learned more about what the ‘right’ tool should do.</p>
<p>When trialling did not help the organisation, it was often because they did not test it with the people who would be using the tool.</p> 
<h2>Tips for success</h2>
<p>There is no substitute for trying a tool out before you decide to adopt it. Ask for demo versions or use free trials. The first version of your tool is unlikely to be the one you want: include field trials in your budget and plan.</p>
<p>Even if you decide to build a new tool, try some existing tools first: it will give you firsthand experience of what your tool needs to do.</p>
<p>If you aren’t representative of the people who will be using the tool, have some target users try out the tool. Replicate the conditions the tool will be used in as far as possible.</p>

<h3>Decide two things:</h3>
<p>If you think that you know enough to choose and implement a tool on your own, go ahead – choose a tool!</p> 
<p>If you need more support or expertise, read on to the next section: Choosing a technical partner or adviser.</p>
<hr />

<h2>Choosing a technical partner or adviser</h2>
<h3>What did the research say?</h3>
<p>Many organisations gave a partner responsibility for choosing the right tool, which had both positive and negative consequences. </p>
<p>Many organisations had relationships with tech providers that were difficult to manage. Tools often did not match expectations, and there were often long delays, bugs in tools,and communication challenges. Many had to terminate their relationships several times.</p>
<p>Developing a new tool from scratch usually took much longer and cost more than expected.</p>

<h3>Tips for success</h3>
<p>Relying too heavily on a partner can be risky, especially if you haven’t managed a relationship like this before. Before you take this route, consider again whether an existing tool wouldn’t be ‘good enough’ or if you couldn’t put more effort into building up your own capacity.</p>
<p>Make the effort to ensure that you have a productive, open relationship with a partner or advisor (to make sure you're getting the right partner, ask potential partners for references and ask your peers for recommendations). </p>
<p>Build capacity in-house rather than allowing partners to do everything. Budget for training or hiring additional staff members. </p>
<p>Do you need a technical partner, or do you just need some technical advice? Agree on clear expectations, roles and responsibilities for each party. Ensure you get clear answers from the provider on what is possible. Break projects up into phases to give you a way to get out if things are not going well.</p>

<p>Been there, done that  - Find out about any similar projects with organizations that have used technologies in similar circumstances in your country, or outside. If you can't find similar projects, look for projects that had similar user groups.</p>
<p>Get references! - before choosing a provider or an existing tool, talk to people who have worked with them before (and preferably more than one). Find out about their technical skills, their work practices, communications, and budget. (D)</p>
<p>If you’re not sure you’ve found what you need, expand your search</p>
<p>visit technology hubs in your area and ask several people there </p>
<p>look for civic tech or similar events in your city</p>
<p>Talk to your donors and funding partners </p>
<p>Ask in universities or other research groups with ICT 4 Development connections.</p>
