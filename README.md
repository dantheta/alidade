# Tool Selection Assistant

## What is it?
The Tool Selection Assistant is a tool designed to provide guidance on choosing technology tools for projects that aim to increase transparency and accountability. 

### What do you mean by "Technology tools"?
We mean a wide range of technology including software like content management systems, data collection systems and social media tools, hardware like mobile phones or any other piece of technology that you use to achieve your goals).

## Will it choose a tool for me? 
No. (There are far too many tools to choose from, and you will know best what tool is right for your context?

### So what does it do?

It guides you through a four-step process that helps you think through your tool selection in a methodical way. 
Each step is divided into 1-10 smaller tasks that you can complete whenever you have time. You can log in to save your answers and return to them later, amending them if you need to. 

The Tool Selection Assistant also collects your decisions as you complete each step. If you log in, you can print the results as a PDF or Word file, using them:

- as a planning document to remind you of what to prioritise and clarify
- to explain to your colleagues what you want the tool to do, using simple language
- to quickly show people outside your organization what you’re looking for – so they can give advice or technical support
- to show potential donors or partners that you’ve really thought through your project.  

## Can I install it on my own server?

Yes! Download the code from the repo and install it by pointing your browser to [your domain]/install.php). 

Note: you will need to properly configure your enviroment variables, found in the file /config/local.example.php. We suggest you copy the file and rename it to "local.php" and proceed to edit the information in the new file.

## Who made this?

Built by [the engine room](https://www.theengineroom.org). Content prepared by [the engine room](https://www.theengineroom.org), [Pawa254](http://pawa254.org/) and [the Network Society initiative at the University of the Witwatersrand](http://www.networksociety.co.za/). This tool was developed as part of a research project supported by [Making All Voices Count](www.makingallvoicescount.org/) in Kenya and South Africa in 2015. We interviewed 38 organisations working on transparency, citizen reporting and increasing government accountability to find out how they chose technology for their projects, and what they would like to have been doing better.
