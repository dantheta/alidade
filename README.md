# Tool Selection Assistant

The Tool Selection Assistant is a tool designed to provide guidance on choosing technology tools for projects that aim to increase transparency and accountability. (By 'technology tools', we mean a wide range of technology including software like content management systems, data collection systems and social media tools, hardware like mobile phones or any other piece of technology that you use to achieve your goals).

It guides you through a four-step process that helps you think through your tool selection in a methodical way. 
Each step is divided into 1-10 smaller tasks that you can complete whenever you have time. You can log in to save your answers and return to them later, amending them if you need to. 

The Tool Selection Assistant also records your decisions as you go, and lets you create a PDF document for each step to present information about your decision-making process to other people.

This tool was developed as part of a research project supported by [Making All Voices Count](www.makingallvoicescount.org/) in Kenya and South Africa in 2015. We interviewed 38 organisations working on transparency, citizen reporting and increasing government accountability to find out how they chose technology for their projects, and what they would like to have been doing better.
